## Description
The Shirt Colour Project is a web application designed to detect and identify the color of shirts in uploaded images. Utilizing advanced machine learning models and image processing techniques, this project aims to provide accurate color detection and categorization for various shirt colors.

## Key Features
- **Color Detection**: Automatically detects the dominant color of the shirt in the uploaded image.
- **Color Categorization**: Maps the detected color to a predefined set of basic colors.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use web interface built with Streamlit for uploading images and viewing results.

## Technologies Used
- **Streamlit**: For building the web interface.
- **YOLO (You Only Look Once)**: A state-of-the-art object detection model used to identify the person in the image.
- **OpenCV**: For image processing tasks.
- **Pillow**: For handling image files.
- **Scikit-learn**: For K-means clustering to find the dominant color.
- **PyTorch**: For loading and running the YOLO model.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.

## Installation
To install the necessary dependencies, run:
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
To start the project, use the following command:
streamlit run shirt.py
